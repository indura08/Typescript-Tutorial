In TypeScript, enums (short for enumerations) are a data type that allows you to define a set of named constants. Enums provide a way to give more friendly names to sets of numeric values.

Here's a basic example of an enum:

enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right
}


In this example, Direction is an enum with four members: Up, Down, Left, and Right. By default, each member is assigned a numeric value starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent member. So, in this case, Up is assigned the value 0, Down is assigned 1, Left is assigned 2, and Right is assigned 3.

enum Direction {
  Up = 1,
  Down = 2,
  Left = 3,
  Right = 4
}
