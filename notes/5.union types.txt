In TypeScript, union types allow you to specify that a value can be of multiple types. This means that a variable, parameter, or property can accept values of different types. Union types are denoted by the vertical bar (|) between the type names.

Here's a basic example of a union type:

let myVariable: string | number;

myVariable = "hello"; // Valid
myVariable = 123;      // Valid
// myVariable = true;  // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'
