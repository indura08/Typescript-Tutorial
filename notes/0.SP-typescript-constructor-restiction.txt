Q: do we really have to create a constructor in typescript no mater what because look at this code : class Node {
    value: number;
    next:Node
    
    
}it shows some error on value and next value like this : Property 'value' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor., im super confused in this case?


A:

This is a great question, and your confusion is very normal 👍
This is not about classes in general — it’s about TypeScript’s strict mode.

Let’s clear this slowly and clearly.

❌ Why TypeScript is complaining

Your code:

class Node {
    value: number;
    next: Node;
}


Error:

Property 'value' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.

What TypeScript is thinking

Because you have:

"strict": true


TypeScript enforces strictPropertyInitialization.

It asks:

“When an object is created, how do I know value and next will not be undefined?”

Since:

No default value

No constructor

No guarantee of assignment

→ TypeScript throws an error at compile time.

⚠️ This is TypeScript-only safety, JavaScript itself doesn’t care.

✅ Do we REALLY need a constructor?
❌ No, not always
✅ But you must guarantee initialization in some way

You have 4 valid options.
For DSA / linked lists, option #1 or #2 is best.

✅ OPTION 1 (BEST for DSA): Use a constructor
class Node {
    value: number;
    next: Node | null;

    constructor(value: number) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = null;
    }
}


✔ Most correct
✔ Most readable
✔ Exactly how linked lists are taught
✔ No confusion later

👉 Recommended

✅ OPTION 2: Use definite assignment (!)
class Node {
    value!: number;
    next!: Node;
}


What ! means:

“Trust me TypeScript, I will assign this later.”

✔ Quick
❌ Dangerous if you forget to assign
❌ Not beginner-friendly

Use only if you know what you’re doing.

✅ OPTION 3: Give default values
class Node {
    value: number = 0;
    next: Node | null = null;
}


✔ Valid
✔ Simple
❌ Not ideal for DSA logic (fake values)

✅ OPTION 4: Make properties optional
class Node {
    value?: number;
    next?: Node;
}


✔ Removes error
❌ Very bad for DSA (everything becomes possibly undefined)

🧠 Why constructors are common in DSA

When you do:

const node = new Node(10);


You want guarantees:

node.value exists

node.next exists (even if null)

That’s why constructors are the cleanest solution.

🔑 Final clear answer

Do we really need a constructor in TypeScript?

❌ No, TypeScript doesn’t force constructors
✅ But with strict mode, every property must be initialized
✅ Constructors are the best and safest way to do that
✅ Especially for DSA and linked lists

My recommendation for YOU (based on your DSA practice)

Use this and move on confidently:

class Node {
    value: number;
    next: Node | null;

    constructor(value: number) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
